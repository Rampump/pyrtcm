Usage:

python3 msmparser.py infile="../tests/pygpsdata-RTCM3.log"


Each RTCM3 MSM message contains data for multiple satellites and cells
(combination of satellite and signal).

pyrtcm parses MSM messages into a flat data structure, with repeating
element names suffixed by a 2-digit index (e.g. `DF405_02`) and
(optionally) labelled with their corresponding satellite PRN and signal ID
e.g. `DF405_02(005,2L)`. Note that indices start at 1, not 0.

It is sometimes more convenient to parse the data into one or more
iterable arrays, with each array element corresponding to a particular
satellite or cell.

This example illustrates how to parse MSM messages from a binary data log
into a series of iterable data arrays keyed on satellite PRN and signal ID.

The output data structure is a tuple containing:

(metadata, [satellite data array], [cell data array]).

Arrays could just as easily be numpy arrays if preferred.
