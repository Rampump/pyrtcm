rtcmpoller.py

This example illustrates how to read and display RTCM messages
"concurrently" with other tasks using threads and queues. This
represents a useful generic pattern for many end user applications.

It implements two threads which run concurrently:
1) an I/O thread which continuously reads RTCM data from the
receiver and sends any queued outbound command or poll messages.
2) a process thread which processes parsed RTCM data - in this example
it simply prints the parsed data to the terminal.
RTCN data is passed between threads using queues.

Press CTRL-C to terminate.

FYI: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not strictly concurrent, though this is of minor
practical consequence here.
